Have you ever thought [i]"You know what Terraria is missing? Gifs."[/i] (Tbh most likely not, but anyways, now you have gifs in Terraria!!)
Gifs are a fun way to spice up your chat in Terraria. You can use them to react to events, make jokes, pollute the chat with garbage or just be cringy in general.

[h1]Warning![/h1]
- As of right now, this mod is still in [b]early stages of development[/b] and it is not perfect. Sending and receiving GIFs can be slow, glitchy, cause memory leaks or even [b]crashes[/b]. So if you're not a fan of those, you might want to hold off on using this mod until it's more stable.
- I also [b]strongly recommend against[b/] using this mod in servers with 5 or more players!
- The mod should theoretically be 100% compatible with most other mods that don't directly manipulate the chat, but I haven't really tested it extensively yet.
- I am also not 100% sure if the mod works correctly on Mac and Linux, let me know if you use those and face any issues!
