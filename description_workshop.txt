Now available for 1.4.4!

Have you ever thought [i]"You know what Terraria is missing? Gifs."[/i] (Tbh most likely not, but anyways, now you have gifs in Terraria!!)
Gifs are a fun way to spice up your chat in Terraria. You can use them to react to events, send memes, pollute the chat with garbage or to be cringy in general.
Use "/help gif" in the chat for instructions.

[h1]Notice[/h1]
- This mod has not been extensively tested in servers with many people and it may cause issues under certain circumstances.
- This mod should be compatible with 99% of other mods, the 1% being mods that directly manipulate the chat box.
- This mod uses Tenor's API to query Gifs, however Gifs can also be sent through URLs. It is preferable to use direct queries to Tenor instead of sending Gifs by URL directly.
- This mod has only been tested properly on Windows and is [b]extremely[/b] likely to cause issues on Mac and Linux.

If this mod causes any issues, please let me know in the comments or message me on Steam.
